## View an invoice

Your invoice includes the following:

- Invoice number
- Date of issue
- Due date
- Your "Bill to" information
- Amount due (in USD)
- Pay online: Select this link to pay your invoice online
- Description of your order, quantity if applicable, unit price, and
amount (in USD)
- Subtotal, discount (if applicable), and total

The information listed in the "Bill to" section of your invoice is based on
your billing information. Not all fields are required. The billing information
includes the following:

- Name (required): The name of the administrator or company
- Address (required)
- Email address (required): The email address that receives all billing-related
emails for the account
- Phone number
- Tax ID or VAT

You canâ€™t make changes to a paid or unpaid billing invoice. When you update
your billing information, this change won't update an existing invoice.

If you need
to update your billing information, make sure you do so before your
subscription renewal date when your invoice is finalized.

For more information, see [Update billing information](details.md).

## Pay an invoice

> [!NOTE]
>
> Pay by invoice is only available for subscribers on an annual billing cycle.
To change your billing cycle, see [Change your billing cycle](/manuals/billing/cycle.md).

If you've selected pay by invoice for your subscription, you'll receive email
reminders to pay your invoice at 10 days before the due date, on the due date,
and 15 days after the due date.

You can pay an invoice from the Docker Billing Console:

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com/) and choose your organization.
1. Select **Billing**.
1. Select **Invoices** and locate the invoice you want to pay.
1. In the **Actions** column, select **Pay invoice**.
1. Fill out your payment details and select **Pay**.

When your payment has processed, the invoice's **Status** column will update to
**Paid** and you will receive a confirmation email.

If you choose to pay using a US bank account, you must verify the account. For
more information, see [Verify a bank account](manuals/billing/payment-method.md#verify-a-bank-account).
